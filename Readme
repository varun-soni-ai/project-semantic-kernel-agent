Implementation Summary

I've created a Semantic Kernel agent for financial data reconciliation that replicates the functionality of your original code. Here's a breakdown of the implementation:

Key Components

1. Main Application (main.py)

> Sets up FastAPI for API endpoints

> Initializes Semantic Kernel and its plugins

> Handles incoming requests and orchestrates the processing flow


2. Database Plugin (plugins/database_plugin.py)

> Handles database connections and SQL execution

> Provides schema information

> Processes query results and formats them as JSON


3. Storage Plugin (plugins/storage_plugin.py)

> Generates CSV files from query results

> Uploads files to Azure Blob Storage

> Returns URLs for downloaded files


4. Query Plugin (plugins/query_plugin.py)

> Classifies user queries (relevant/list request/general)

> Generates SQL queries based on user input

> Handles specialized processing for list requests


5. Response Plugin (plugins/response_plugin.py)

> Formats responses based on query results

> Ensures proper inclusion of CSV URLs when available

> Maintains consistent style with emojis and formatting


Key Benefits of Semantic Kernel Implementation

1. Modular Architecture: Clear separation of concerns with specialized plugins

2. Maintainability: Each plugin handles a specific responsibility

3. Extensibility: Easy to add new capabilities by creating additional plugins

4. Scalability: Plugins can be deployed independently if needed

5. Improved Developer Experience: Better code organization and readability
